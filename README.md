## Features

- Automatically sends connection requests to profiles in LinkedIn search results.
- Skips profiles that are already connected.
- Displays the count of sent connection requests.
- Allows users to start and stop the connection process from a popup interface.

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome Browser
- LinkedIn Account (logged in)

## Permissions
